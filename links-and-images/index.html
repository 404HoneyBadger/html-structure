<h1><center><b>Do Unicorns Exist?</b></center></h1>
<h2><center>What is a Unicorn?</center></h2> 
<p>Unicorn means <mark>"one horn."</mark> Most often, a unicorn is depicted as a white, horse-like creature with a single horn growing from its forehead. Sometimes, a unicorn is seen as a deer, donkey, or goat with a single horn. The horn is often long and straight, marked with spiral striations along its length. Moreover, unicorns are typically depicted as having cloven hooves like cattle, deer, or goats, which is dissimilar to the single-toed hooves of horses. But unicorns often are seen sporting similar coat colors to horses, with white being the most common color.
Unicorns supposedly have been endowed with many magical qualities. For instance, unicorn tears and blood are said to be healing, and powdered unicorn horn is said to be an antidote to poison. Furthermore, unicorns are apparently difficult to catch—not unlike some horses who don&apos;t like to be caught—and in many mythologies only young maidens can tame them. They are a symbol of ferociousness, freedom, power, and speed, and they appear on many coats of arms and emblems.</p>
<h2><center>The Experts Weigh In</center></h2>
<p>While horses have an extensive fossil record, there are no confirmed fossils of unicorns. But that hasn't stopped people from trying to find unicorn remains.
<p>One of the principal characters in the book Remarkable Creatures by Tracy Chevalier is based on the life of English paleontologist Mary Anning. Anning collected fossils but didn't understand what the fossilized creatures were. For instance, fossils we now know are cephalopods were thought to be coiled snakes. Straight cephalopod shells were also found, and many people thought these were unicorn horns.</p>
<p>Several unicorn skeletons also have been discovered, but all of them have been deemed fake. In the 1600s, German scientist and inventor Otto von Guericke created a fake unicorn skeleton with bones locals found in a cave. And a sketch based on the model was even included in a book on natural history written in the 1700s. Whether the original fake was created out of fun or the creator thought he was building a real unicorn is unknown.</p>
